## Simple JSON Parser in Java

- This was an educational attempt to understand parsers
- Java version of Eaton Phil's [JsonParser](https://github.com/eatonphil/pj/tree/master) written in go.
- Added some extra logic to improve number detection
- Very scrappy code, could improve a lot of things especially the exceptional handling.
